## Recent Work  

**Fine-Tuning Falcon-7B on Persian QA**  
First attempt at fine-tuning Falcon-7B on the Persian QA (PQuAD) dataset. Overcame VRAM limits, dataset errors, and overfitting challenges.  

**Evaluating Llama-3.1-8B (4-bit) on SQuAD**  
Zero-shot and few-shot prompting for QA tasks. Few-shot prompting significantly improved performance.  

**Fine-Tuning ParsBERT on Persian QA (PQuAD)**  
Worked on fine-tuning ParsBERT for Persian QA using Colab T4 GPU. Overcame dataset loading errors, overfitting, and limited VRAM.  

**Persian Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
Set up a RAG pipeline with **LangChain, ChromaDB, and vLLM** for Persian QA. Tackled PDF loading and GPU memory limits.  

**Web Crawling & Data Collection**  
Built crawlers for Vigiato and other Persian websites to collect and preprocess large-scale text datasets.  

**Interactive RAG Project (University Project)**  
Developed a document-based QA system enabling interaction with LLMs on specific inputs.  

**Other Projects**  
- Personality Test Web App (Flask + Whisper)  
- Weather Analysis with MapReduce & Docker  
- Vector Space Model for IR  
- Microcontroller Projects (STM32)
